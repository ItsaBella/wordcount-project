<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>This is not my first attempt in writing html code, however, this is fun because I get to use python as I write html. I guess that's what django is all about. Writing python within html. Anyway, this is so much fun so far and I can't wait to move to the next lecture to see what else I can do with html paired with python.</p>
